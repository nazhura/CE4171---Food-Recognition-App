Your Health Buddy: food recognition app

For this project, we were given the choice to choose whatever we wanted to do, as long as there is a connection to the cloud. I developed this mobile app to let the users take a picture of a food infront of them, and the app will predict what food it is, and additionally, how many calories the food has. I used the keras library for the prediction of the food and Flutter for the UI of the app.

Enjoy the demo video :)<br>
